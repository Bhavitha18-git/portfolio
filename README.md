Welcome to my personal portfolio! I'm Bhavitha, a 3rd year student at NIT Warangal, passionate about blending code, design, and creativity.

## About Me
I write code in **C++** and love exploring **Python** when curiosity strikes. For building websites and apps, I let **AI** lend a hand, and I use **no-code tools** when speed matters. I'm also a designer—crafting sleek, interactive interfaces in **Figma** and **Canva**.

Tech, to me, should feel alive, playful, and human. This portfolio is more than a showcase—it's a space where design meets code, and I get to be creative.
